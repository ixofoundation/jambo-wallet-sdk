    An SDK to easily access the Opera mobile wallet for JAMBO dapps
</h2>

<br />

This repo and product is intentionally managed as Open Source and we aim to use this guide to light our way https://opensource.guide/.
Let us know how we are doing!

## ðŸ”¨ Install

```sh
npm install @ixo/jambo-wallet-sdk

yarn add  @ixo/jambo-wallet-sdk
```

## ðŸ’» Usage

This SDK interacts with the Opera mobile wallet and exposes new functions that'll make interaction with the wallet easier, and these exposed functions mimic the same structure as the Keplr browser extension wallet.

To use the SDK, you can call the `getOpera` function, which returns an object of methods similar to the Keplr wallet if it can access the Opera mobile wallet. Otherwise, it returns undefined.

```js
import { getOpera } from '@ixo/jambo-wallet-sdk';

const operaWallet = await getOpera();

if (operaWallet) {
	// interact with the opera mobile wallet using the SDK
}
```

The `OperaWallet` object returned by `getOpera()` includes the following functions:

### enable

```ts
async enable(chainNameOrId: string, chainNetwork: ChainNetwork = 'mainnet'): Promise<void>
```

Enables a chain with the given chain ID or name-and-network type. If the chain is not yet enabled, it retrieves the chain info via the [@ixo/cosmos-chain-resolver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ixo/cosmos-chain-resolver) from the Cosmos or Keplr chain registries and stores it locally for further usage.

### experimentalSuggestChain

```ts
async experimentalSuggestChain(chainInfo: KeplrChainInfo): Promise<void>
```

Suggests a new or custom chain by providing a chain info object. This is very useful if the chain info cannot be found by the [@ixo/cosmos-chain-resolver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ixo/cosmos-chain-resolver).

### getKey

```ts
async getKey(chainId: string, includeDid: boolean = false): Promise<OperaKey | undefined>
```

Retrieves the account 'key' associated with the provided chain ID. The returned 'key' includes the following fields:

- name: string (an empty string)
- algo: string (secp256k1)
- pubKey: uint8Array
- address: uint8Array
- bech32Address: string
- isNanoLedger: boolean (false)
- isKeystone: boolean (false)

If the `includeDid` flag is set to true, `getKey` also includes the did (Decentralized Identifier) associated with the account key.

Additionally, `getKey` stores the user's data in session storage to be used by the offline signer, so it needs to be called at least once for every session.

To provide a better user experience, we advise against calling `getKey` too frequently. This is because `getKey` requires the user to authenticate via fingerprint scan, facial recognition, or password (depending on the authentication method enabled on their device/opera mobile browser), which may be cumbersome for the user.

### getOfflineSigner

```ts
async getOfflineSigner(chainId: string): Promise<OfflineDirectSigner | null>
```

Returns an offline signer for the given chain ID.

### signDirect

```ts
signDirect(signerAddress: string, signDoc: SignDoc): Promise<DirectSignResponse>
```

Signs a transaction with the specified signer address.

### **raw** (for advanced developers)

The `__raw__` property exposes the original `interchain` object provided by the OperaWallet on the `window` object. This property is intended for advanced developers who require direct access to the underlying `interchain` object for more complex use cases.

Please note that the OperaWallet's `interchain` object, including the `__raw__` property, is not officially documented. Using it directly may lead to unexpected behavior or errors, and should be done only by developers who have a thorough understanding of how it works and why it is necessary for their use case. If you are unsure whether you need to use `__raw__`, we recommend using the aforementioned documented methods and properties instead.

## ðŸ“± Example

```ts
const opera = getOpera()

// initialize opera with custom chain info
const initializeOpera = async (chainInfo: ChainInfo): Promise<Key | undefined> => {
	try {
		if (!opera) throw new Error('Opera not available');
		await opera.experimentalSuggestChain(chainInfo);
		await opera.enable(chainInfo.chainId);
		const key = await opera.getKey(chainInfo.chainId);
		return key;
	} catch (error) {
		console.error('Error initializing Opera:: ' + error);
	}
};

// or
// initialize opera using a chain ID
const chainId = 'ixo-5';

const initializeOpera = async (): Promise<Key | undefined> => {
	try {
		if (!opera) throw new Error('Opera not available');
		await opera.enable(chainId);
		const key = await opera.getKey(chainId);
		return key;
	} catch (error) {
		console.error('Error initializing Opera:: ' + error);
	}
};

// sign transaction with offline signer
const key = initializeOpera();

const trx = [{
	typeUrl: '/cosmos.bank.v1beta1.MsgSend'
	value: {
		fromAddress: key.bech32Address,
		toAddress: 'ixo1wnw8t3gc...ezn7xge',
		amount: [{
			denom: 'uixo',
			amount: '1000000'
		}]
	}
}]

const offlineSigner = await opera.getOfflineSigner(chainId);

const signingClient = await createSigningClient(rpcEndpoint, offlineSigner);

// signingClient.signAndBroadcast(signerAddress: string, messages: readonly EncodeObject[], fee: number | StdFee | "auto", memo?: string | undefined)
await signingClient.signAndBroadcast(key.bech32Address, trx, 'auto', undefined);
```
